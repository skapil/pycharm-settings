Pycharm Django Development Settings

I use pycharm as my development env for django/backbone development. Really happy to use this env
as it make my lot of task including pushing the code to remove env and restarting the django server really easy.

<ul>
        <li> Open the Pycharm </li>
        <li> Click on File -> Settings </li>
        <li> Click on import Settings </li>
        <li> Select All on pop up </li>
</ul>


AWESOME!! You are ready!!
